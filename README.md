# hugo theme distinct

A highly idiosyncratic and mostly handwritten theme for
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that I am using for my personal website.
I liked bits and pieces from other themes, but wasn't completely satisfied
so I decided to create my own from scratch.

I've focused on making this theme clear and easy to read, which is why I call it
"distinct".

I've been piecing this together over the course of a year and a half, with
large gaps in between. I can't entirely explain my train of thought now but
hopefully I can sit down and write down what design aspects went into this.

For now, enjoy the writings of a madman.

Colors are based on [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
Fonts are
[Gidole](https://gidole.github.io/),
[Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway),
and [Terminus](https://files.ax86.net/terminus-ttf).
The image gallery functionality is
[PhotoSwipe](https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe).
I also got the base CSS theme for PhotoSwipe from the PhotoSwipe repository.

The integration of PhotoSwipe into Hugo is almost entirely derived from
[hugo-easy-gallery](https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery). I would not
have been able to figure out PhotoSwipe (quickly) without this project and
Li-Wen's other writings.

You can see this theme in action at [my website](https://conn.cx).
